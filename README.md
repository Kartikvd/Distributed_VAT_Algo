# Distributed_VAT_Algo
Clustering Tendency Assessment of IoT-Generated Spatio-Temporal Data in Distributed Systems

The image below provides scatter plots of clustered physical parameters on the left and clustered spatio-temporal parameters on the right, which are the outputs of the code.

*** Code is written understandably with comments wherever required. ***

Steps to run the code:
1) Open the git_dnccVAT_MIT.m in MATLAB software.
2) With all the files in the same folder, run the code.
3) You will get the output as displayed above, along with the MST-iVAT image and scatter plot of the physical parameters.

Files:
1) git_dnccVAT_MIT.m : Is the main file.
2) distance2.m : To find euclidean distance between points, else use other distance metric.
3) MST-iVAT.m : Is the minimum spanning tree improved visual assessment of clustering tendency function to develop an MST-iVAT image.
4) SXYTHLEI_MIT.mat : Is the MIT data used in the main code.
